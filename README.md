# 02104-Snake
A version of snake with new fruits, options for multiplayer and procedurally generated levels and a save load system!
## Running the program
The expected way to run the program is by opening the jar through command line with two inputs *n* and *m* that control column- and rowcount respectively.
The command you can use to run the program is java -jar <NameOfJarFile> <columncount> <rowcount>
If not running it in this way it will default to a 30x30 board but is still perfectly functional.

The program expects you use azul-zulu. Here is where you can find it.
https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk-fx#zulu
If you still have errors after having downloaded azul here, make sure that you actually running it with the right java. You may have other versions installed that doesn't work.
